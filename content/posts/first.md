Finally after setting up the whole blog page I'm able to post something that I'm currently thinking about.
To be fair it was not a technical difficulty, it was mostly my own laziness and lack of willingness.
From now on I may try to post out things in somewhat frequent matter.

This post may not be interesting to most of the people, but it is my way to start out with pouring my own ideas into words.
Seeing some of the people doing great job creating YouTube videos I wanted to do the same thing, but I don't have a niche, that I would like to comply to.
For now I want to start out with some blogs on my current projects, as well as some of the research that I may try to conduct.
After that I may want to start doing something on YouTube, but until then I will just focus on boosting my own productivity via these posts.

The main goal of these blog posts is to make me more **motivated to work** on my projects and really stick to them, instead of leaving them unfinished.
The other goal is to spread the **knowledge** and help others that may be in the same situation as me.
I know that a lot of people stuggle with the same problems in IT, as burnouts are pretty common in carrers, so as in private projects. 

Currently on my mind there are a few things that I would like to take care of until the end of summer holidays (until 30th August for me). That is not that much time, but I don't have much plans starting from today, so I may try make this posts a daily thing.

So these are the main thing that I would like to achieve in a near future:

- [ ] Prepare my Linux setup for the 2nd year of studies
- [ ] Prepare a system for organizing time, notes and files 
- [ ] Learn how to use vim and overall only keyboard workflow
- [ ] Think of a small project that would help with learning Rust and Haskell
- [ ] Create a better workflow for the blog posts and organize the repo

Each point may be done in parallel to diverisify the work and help with boredom. I will post separate blog posts that will discuss these points in more detail. For now this is end of the post, but I may update it with some more useful informations.

Thanks to anyone who reads this!
