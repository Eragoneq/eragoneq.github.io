# Personal github [page](https://eragoneq.github.io/)

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## Reasoning

After some thought, I understood that creating my own website and doing everything on my own is gonna take quite a while.
I'm not really a web developer, but I would like to try out my blogging skills.

For now I'm gonna use this static page generator with a customized theme and maybe in the future I will update this to something more interesting.

## TODOs

* [ ] Finish the site setup
* [ ] Add some more profile information
* [ ] Prepare proper post templates
* [ ] Write a few blogposts
